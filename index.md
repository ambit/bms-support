The aim of the Help Centre is to be a comprehensive guide to BMS.

In [Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/finding-contacts/), we cover topics that will help you navigate through BMS, as well as various ways to use the software more efficiently.

Whilst in the [News]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/) section, we have information on all the latest software releases to enhance and improve on BMS.

## So what is BMS, exactly?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template
directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (or
[Textile](http://textile.sitemonks.com/)) and
[Liquid](http://wiki.shopify.com/Liquid)
converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable
for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine
behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which means you can use Jekyll
to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers **for
free**.
