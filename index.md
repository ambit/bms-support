The aim of this Help Centre is to be a comprehensive guide to your Business Management Software (BMS).

In [Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/finding-contacts/), we cover topics that will help you navigate through BMS, as well as various ways to use the software more efficiently.

Whilst in the [News]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/) section, we have information on all the latest software releases.

## So what is BMS, exactly?

BMS is essentially enterprise resource planning (ERP) software for the modern, <a class="noRedirect" href="http://ovum.com/2013/04/05/ovum-industry-congress-to-provide-overview-of-the-customer-adaptive-enterprise/" target="_blank">customer-adaptive enterprise</a>. 

The software maintains a 'single source of truth' for your valuable customer data, empowering employees with increased visibility, for faster and smarter decision making. It's configured as a hosted Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution to take advantage of the redundancy, scalability and efficiency inherent in managed, cloud based software. For complete accessibility, the interface is optimised to work seamlessly across all manner of device sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) via responsive design principles.

BMS features <a class="noRedirect" href="http://bmserp.com#features" target="_blank">core modules</a> for Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Billing and Revenue Management (BRM), Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Service Lifecycle Management (SLM). We believe that our core modules add great value when combined in the one application - a single customer file, tracking all interactions, for consolidated work-flow and reporting.

<a class="noRedirect" href="http://bmserp.com#extensions" target="_blank">Extensions and Integrations</a> provide powerful new features and services to enhance the BMS core modules. In-built flexibility allows for individual customisation, with a number of industry solutions available to facilitate customisation at a lower total cost of ownership.

Developing business software for the customer-adaptive enterprise means we don't focus on the 'internal' management software for Accounting and Payroll (seen in typical ERP software) and instead deliver just the complementary 'external' modules dealing directly with customers. Accounting and Payroll are well served by existing vendors (such as <a class="noRedirect" href="http://www.xero.com/" target="_blank">Xero</a> and <a class="noRedirect" href="http://www.workday.com/" target="_blank">Workday</a>) and we therefore offer direct integrations with popular vendors to complete our customer's ERP solutions.
