A contact is any business that is recorded in the CRM database.

In this section, we'll go through a couple of the most common ways of navigating to a specific contact.

## The Contacts Index

By clicking on the contacts icon in the navigation menu, the contacts index will appear. The contact index is a list of all the contacts in the system. Clicking on a business name in the index you will be directed to the details page for that contact.

## Contacts Search

At the top of the menu bar on the left you will find contact search. If you have a particular contact in mind, this is the most efficient way to get to that contact.

<div class="note">
  <span class="fa fa-star fa-lg">&nbsp;</span>
  <h5>Ideally search by contact name, however other fields such as postcode or address will work.</h5>
</div>

## Contacts Filter

As the contacts index can be very large, you will probably want to use the filter to narrow it down a bit. See [Filters and Pagination](../core-filters-and-pagination/) for more information.

## Contacts Find

Another quick way to narrow the list is to apply a text filter on a column in the index. You do this by choosing the Find button in the top right.

## Prev and Next Contact

When viewing a Contact, you can navigate to the previous or next contacts (relative to the contact index you just accessed it from) by clicking on the Prev Contact or Next Contact links in the contact's Summary Pane. This will take you to the previous/next sequential contact in the contact list.

![Prev and Next Contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/crm-contact-prev-next.jpg)

<div class="note info">
  <span class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg">&nbsp;</span>
  <h5>The previous and next links take into account any filtering you may have performed on the contact index, and use the filtered list as the collection that it is moving sequentially through.</h5>
</div>
