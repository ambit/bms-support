A contact is any business that is recorded in the CRM database.

In this section, we'll go through a couple of the most common ways of navigating to a specific contact.

By clicking on the contacts icon in the navigation menu, the contacts submenu will appear. From here you can choose to search for a contact, add a new contact, or view the contact list.

## The Contact List

The contact list is an index of all the contacts in the system. By clicking on an item in the index you will be directed to the details page for that contact.

As this list can be very large, you will probably want to use the filter to narrow it down a bit. See [Filters and Pagination](../filters-and-pagination/) for more information.

The contacts submenu includes shortcuts to the full contact list, as well as a number of saved filters.

## The Search Bar

At the top of the submenu you will find contact search. The most efficient method is to search by contact name, however other fields such as postcode or address will work.

## Prev and Next Buttons

When viewing a Contact, you can navigate to the previous or next contacts (relative to the contact list) by clicking on the Prev Contact or Next Contact buttons in the contact's Summary Pane. This will take you to the previous/next sequential contact in the contact list.

The previous and next buttons take into account any filtering you may have performed on the contact list, and use the filtered list as the collection that it is moving sequentially through.
