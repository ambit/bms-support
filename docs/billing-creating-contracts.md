## New Contract

New contracts can be created from the contracts tab of a customer. When you select this button is will present you with a list of contract profiles to choose from. Selecting one of these profiles will take you through to the New Contract form.

## Contract Profiles

Contract Profiles are configured in the Admin Settings and provide a predefined template for setting up a contract. The Contract Profile sets a number of default values in the new contract form, speeding up the data entry process and reducing errors.

Additionally, Contract Profiles can have charges defined that are specific to that profile.

## Charge Profiles

Charge Profiles can be configured in Admin Settings either within a particular Contract Profile (and thus only available to that profile), or separately from the Contract Profiles (whereby it is available to be used on any contract).

Charge Profiles define a particular combination of rates and charge settings. For example, the rate might be for a particular service agent, related to a specific type of meter, or configure a predefined finance and service rate.

## Assigning Assets

Once you have created the contract and its charges, you can allocate assets to the contract, and associate those assets with a particular charge.

## Activating A Contract

Activating the contract will generate a number of Pending Billings, matching the contract length and billing terms.
