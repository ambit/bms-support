The customer details page is split into two sections – the summary pane and the contents pane.

## Summary Pane

The summary pane shows a summary of the customer you're viewing, as well as the actions you can perform on that customer, like editing contact information.

* Heading – the customers full name.
* Toolbar – dropdown for editing the customer.
* Contact Details – At-a-glance information about the customer, such as address, email, phone number, and the main contact at the customer.

## Contents Pane

The contents pane is split into tabs – these are all the sections that describe the customer in detail. Selecting a link at the top of the contents pane will display the related tab in the area below.

All content tabs have a toolbar at the top which will display tools relevant to that section, as well as pagination (if necessary).

## Contacts

The contacts tab allows you to record all the people you interact with at a customer. Keeping track of contacts at a business allows you to target your interactions with the customer.

Selecting New Contact will take you to a new contact screen where you can enter their details. You only need to record the persons name, however optionally you can add information about their position, phone number, and/or email address.
