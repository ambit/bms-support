BMS is organised into applications, which are the core components of BMS. Each application is then split into different functional sections.

## Navigation Menu

On the left side of your display is the navigation menu. You can access the different sections of the current application by selecting an icon in this menu, which then opens up a submenu for the section you selected.

Within the submenu, you will see the name of the section you are in, with a list of options below that. Each submenu is highlighted by a different colour for easy reference.

## Application Menu

You can access the different applications in BMS by selecting the 'select application' icon in the top left of the navigation menu. The submenu will then display a list of all applications you have access to. Selecting one of these options will take you to that applications landing page.

## User Permissions

To keep things simple for users and to keep information secure, BMS only lets you see what you need to see. This applies to which Applications you can access, down to the what information you can see/modify within the applications. Keep this in mind when you are wondering why your colleague can see some things in BMS that you can't, and vice versa.

For more information on what you can and can't see, you should ask your BMS Administrator for a run down of roles and permissions in your environment.
