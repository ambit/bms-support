BMS is organised into modules, which are the core components of BMS. Each module is then split into different functional sections.

## Navigation Menu

On the left side of your display is the navigation bar. You can access the different sections of the current module by selecting an icon in this menu, which then opens up a submenu for the section you selected.

Within the submenu, you will see the name of the section you are in, with a list of options below that. Each submenu is shaded in a different colour for easy reference.

## Module Menu

You can access the different modules of BMS by selecting the current module icon in the bottom left of the menu bar. The submenu will then display a list of all modules you have access to. Selecting one of these options will take you to that modules landing page.

## User Permissions

To keep things simple and to keep information safe, BMS only lets you see what you need to see. This applies to which Modules you can access, down to the what information you can see/modify within the modules. Keep this in mind when you are wondering why your workmate can see some things in BMS that you can't, and viceversa.

For more information on what you can and can't see, you should ask your BMS Administrator for a run down of roles and permissions in your environment.
