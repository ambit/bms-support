The tasks list is like a todo list for you interactions with a contact.

<div class="note">
  <span class="fa fa-star fa-lg">&nbsp;</span>
  <h5>Use tasks to remind you to make a callback, set meeting times, or check up on a contact.</h5>
</div>

## Tasks Index

The task index displays all the tasks you have the permissions to view (generally just your own tasks), sorted by due date. For your convenience they are grouped into time periods, such as Overdue, Today and Next Week - with one tab per time period. Additionally, Completed Tasks and All Tasks will be displayed after the time period tabs.

## New Task

The New Task button will open a form for setting a new task. By default the task will be assigned to you, but you can change this to delegate a task to another user. You can also set a due date (either with a general time span, or with specific date).

## Completing A Task

You can complete a task by ticking the checkbox to the left of the task. This will open a new activity form, where you are required to log an activity with the details of the action you performed when completing the task.

## Edit A Task

Editing the Task allows you to change the Task Description, Date, or Assignee.

## Comment On Tasks

You can add a new comment to a Task from the menu on the right of each Task. Selecting New Comment will open a form for recording new comments via a textbox, and an optional file attachment field.

Existing comments on a task can be viewed as a list inline, below the Task.

## Appointment Sheet

You can view an appointment sheet for each Task, which is a printable summary of the contact â€“ useful for a bit of last-minute cramming before a meeting.
