All interactions with a contact are recorded as Activities.

The Activities index should read as a detailed timeline, informing you (and other users) on any calls, meetings, emails, or any other interaction you might have with a contact. It displays all the Activities recorded for a contact, along with options to create follow-up tasks and follow-up opportunities. Additionally, administrators also have the option to delete and edit existing activities.

When viewing Activities on a Contact, you can select New Activity, which will display a form for entering a new activity.

Alternatively, completing a Task will prompt you to create a New Activity as part of the Task completion.
