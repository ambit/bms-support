  <h5>All interactions with a contact are recorded as Activities.</h5>
</div>

The Activities index should read as a detailed timeline, informing you (and other users) on any calls, meetings, emails, or any other interaction you might have with a contact. It displays all the Activities recorded for a contact, along with options to create follow up tasks directly from the activity. Additionally, administrators also have the option to delete and edit existing activities.

## New Activity

When viewing Activities on a Contact, you can select New Activity, which will display a form for entering a new activity.

![Activity New]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/crm-activity-new.jpg)

Alternatively, completing a Task will prompt you to create a New Activity as part of the Task completion.

## Follow Up Task

You can also create one or many Follow Up Tasks directly from an activity

![Activity Task]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/crm-activity-task.jpg)
