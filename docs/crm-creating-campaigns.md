Campaigns are used to create bulk tasks across a subset of contacts, and assign those task to one or many users.

## Creating a Campaign

On the Add New Campaign form you give the campaign a descriptive name and (optionally) state the objectives. All the other fields are likewise optional: a Status, Budget, Target Revenue, Actual Sales, Actual Revenue, a Start and End date for the campaign, as well as the target number of opportunities.

## Attaching Contacts to a Campaign

First you select 'Attach Contacts to Campaign', then from the subindex you apply one or many filters to get a specific subset of your contacts. Once you have narrowed down your contacts to a smaller list, you select Attach to Campaign, then Attach ALL Contacts to attach all the contacts you filtered, to the campaign.

Alternatively you can manually select specific contacts and choose Attach Selected, instead of Attach ALL Contacts.

## Generating Tasks

Once you have attached a number of contacts to a campaign, you can generate bulk tasks and assign them to specific users.

First you apply a filter to get the specific subset of attached contacts that you want to generate a specific task (for a specific user), then you select all the contacts and click 'Generate tasks for selected'.

Alternatively, you can not apply a filter and just manually select groups of contacts and generate a specific task for each group you select.
