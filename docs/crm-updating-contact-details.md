  <h5>The CRM is only as useful as the data that is recorded in it. It's important to keep all contact information as up to date as possible. Make a habit of double checking and updating contact information whenever you are working on a specific contact.</h5>

## For Businesses

When viewing a business, select 'Edit Contact' from the dropdown in the toolbar, situated on the summary pane. This will take you to the edit contact screen, where you can change most of the attributes of the Business. You can update the business name, specify optional details such as sales area or trading name, as well as add multiple addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and identifiers.

## For Individuals

When viewing a business, navigate to it's 'People' section to see a list of all the people related to that business. Select a person and you'll be taken to the edit person screen, which has mostly the same options as edit business. You can update the persons name, as well as add multiple addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses.
