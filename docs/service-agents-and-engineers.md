Agents can be classed as either Service or Finance businesses.

Within each class (Service or Finance), there is also two types of agent - 'external' agents (independent businesses) or 'internal' agents (one of your internal business entities).

## Finance Agents

A Finance Agent is linked to the Finance component of a contract.

## Service Agents

A Service Agent is linked to the Service component of a contract. You can have multiple Service Agents linked to a single contract, as different agents might be responsible for Assets at different geographic locations.

They are also utilised in the Service application, where we specify their rates and link them to engineers who can complete service jobs.

## External Agents

External Agents can be configured to either:

* Only bill us for their component (service or finance), whilst we bill the customer for the complete invoice.
* Bill on our behalf, where we bill the agent for our component (service or finance), whilst they send the customer a complete invoice.

## Internal Agents

Internal Agents don't require this configuration as we will always do the billing for an internal agent.
