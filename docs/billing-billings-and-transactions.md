## Billing Details

After clicking on the 'Billing Reference' from the billings index, you will be directed to the billing details page.

On the summary pane, you can see the 'Billing Reference' in the header, with the 'Status' for the billing period in the toolbar below. Clicking on the toolbar gives you the option to 'Generate Transaction' for that billing period.

Below the toolbar is all the relevant details for the billing period. The 'BMS Ref' is the auto-generated reference for the billing, whilst 'Customer Ref' is an optional field when creating the contract. The 'Billing No' identifies which billing this is in the life of the contract, and the 'Customer' and 'Contract' fields are links through to the actual customer and contract. Below these details are all the date fields - the 'Due On' date, as well as the date periods for 'Base', 'Usage' and 'Recon'.

On the content pane to the right, there is a single tab for 'Transactions'.

## Customer and Contract Billings

The billings tab within customers and contracts displays a list of billings down the page, grouped by month. Each billing is colour coded to indicate it's status - green for 'Complete', orange for 'Open', blue for 'Pending'.

On the left of each billing you have the 'Customer Name', 'Contract ID' and the 'Billing Number'. Clicking on the billing will expand it to show more details like the 'Type' of billing, the 'Due Date', and the 'Date Period' applicable for the billing.

Additionally, there will be a grid below with a list of transactions relevant to the billing. The 'Transaction ID' is a link to the actual transaction. The grid also displays the 'Status', 'Value' and 'Date', as well as the 'Number of Meters' read and a link to the 'Invoice' (if applicable).

Expanding a 'Pending' billing will also display a blue action button to 'Generate Transaction' for that billing period.
