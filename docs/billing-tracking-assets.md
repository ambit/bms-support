The assets index is a grid of assets where the 'Serial No' is a link to the actual asset, and the 'Owner' is a link to the Customer. We also display the 'Brand', 'Product Code' and  'Site'.

## Summary Pane

The summary pane on the left includes the 'Product Name' and 'Serial Number' in the header, with links through to the customer and their assets via the 'Customer' and 'Location' fields. It also includes the site 'Address' for the asset, and any applicable 'Meters'.

## Readings

The readings tab is a grid that lists all the historic meter readings for this asset. It includes fields for the 'Type' of reading, the 'User' who inputed it, a 'Source Reference', 'Sourced On' date, the 'Meter' and it's 'Reading'.

**New Reading**

The 'New reading' action button will display a form at the top of the page where you can input the 'Sourced On' date, optionally add a 'Source Reference' as well as input the individual readings for any meters on the asset.

<div class="note info">
  <span class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg">&nbsp;</span>
  <h5>Inputing the reading for multiple meters will create multiple lines in the readings grid (one for each meter).</h5>
</div>


## New Assets

Within the billing application, Assets can only be created from within a customer or contract page (the 'New Asset' form is the same in both locations).

Selecting 'New Asset' will display a new asset form at the top of the page where you can enter the asset details. After selecting an existing 'Product Code', it will automatically populate the fields for 'Brand', 'Description' and 'Product Class'. Site displays a list of sites (as seen in the sites tab). The 'Serial No' is a unique identifier for the asset, whilst the 'Cost Centre' is an un-validated text field.
