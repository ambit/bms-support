A contact is any business or person that is recorded in the CRM database.

In this section, we'll go through a couple of the most common ways of navigating to a specific contact.

By clicking on the contacts icon in the navigation menu, the contacts submenu will appear. From here you can choose to search for a contact, add a new contact, or view the contact list.

## The Contact List

The contact list is an index of all the contacts in the system. By clicking on an item in the index you will be directed to the details page for that contact.

As this list can be very large, you will probably want to use the filter to narrow it down a bit. See [Filters and Pagination](../filters-and-pagination/) for more information.

The contacts submenu includes shortcuts to the full contact list, as well as a number of saved filters.

## The Search Bar

At the top of your display you will find BMS Search. When you are accessing the CRM Module, BMS Search will return Contacts matching your search term. The best method is to search by contact name, however other fields such as postcode or address will work.

## Next and Previous Buttons

When viewing a Contact, you can navigate to the next or previous contacts (relative the contact list) by clicking on the Next Contact or Prev Contact buttons in the contact's Summary Pane. This will take you to the next/previous sequential contact in the contact list.

The next and previous buttons take into account any filtering you may have performed on the contact list, and use the filtered list as the collection that it is moving sequentially through.)

## Finding Individual People

Individual people – for example a receptionist, decision-maker, CEO etc – can be recorded as unique contacts in BMS CRM, with their own contact details. You can navigate to these people either via the Contact List or the Search Bar.

Remember: people belong to businesses, so navigating to an individual person will direct you to their parent business's people section.

By default, the contact list filters to show only contact's recorded as a business – if you want to see individual people on this list you should open the filter and remove the contact type filter field.
