Establish Assets and track their Jobs, Meters, Parts and Supplies.

## New Asset

Sales Order dropdown is only populated once Customer is selected. It is further refined if Site is selected. Sales Order Line dropdown is then only populated once a Sales Order is selected.

If Sales Order and Sales Order Line are selected it will prefill the Product Code, Brand, Description and Category. But if the Product Code is changed, Sales Order and Sales Order Line are then cleared.

The reason for having the option to link the Asset to a Sales Order is so that Made-To-Order assets can automatically have their actual components listed, without having to manually add each component used.
