The contact screen is where the majority of your interactions with BMS CRM take place. You should be looking at the contact screen whenever you're interacting with a contact, and adding as much information as possible.

The contact screen is split into two sections – the Summary Pane and the Contents Pane.

## Summary Pane

The summary pane shows a summary of the contact you're viewing, as well as a few actions you can perform on that contact, like editing contact information or managing tags.

* Heading – the contacts full name
* Toolbar – options for editing the contact, as well as navigating sequentially (see Finding Contacts)
* Tags – any tags that have been added to the contact, as well as a toggle to manage those tags (see Managing Tags)
* Contact Info – At-a-glance information about the contact, such as address, phone number, and primary people at the contact. Also included is a brand list, which gives a little run down of the relevant brands owned/installed at the contact.

## Contents Pane

The contents pane is split into tabs – these are all the sections that describe the contact in detail. Selecting a button at the top of the contents pane will display the related tab in the area below.

All content tabs have a toolbar at the top which will display tools relevant to that section, as well as pagination (if necessary).

## Activities

All interactions with a contact are recorded here. The activities list should read as a detailed timeline, informing you (and other users) on any calls, meetings, emails, or any other interaction you might have with the contact. For more detail on working with activities, see Recording Activities.

Selecting New Activity will display a form for entering a new activity.

The activity list below displays all the activities recorded for the contact, along with options to create follow-up tasks and follow-up opportunities. Additionally, administrators also have the option to delete and edit existing activities.

## Tasks

The tasks list is like a todo list for the contact. It can be used to remind you to make a callback, set meeting times, or just to check up on a contact. For more information about using tasks to organise your life, see Working with Tasks.

The New Task button will open a form for setting a new task. By default the task will be assigned to you, but you can change this to delegate a task to another user. You can also set a due date (either with a general time span, or with specific date).

The task list displays all the tasks for a contact, sorted by due date. For your convenience they are grouped into time periods, such as Next Week, Today, and Overdue. Additionally, completed tasks will be displayed at the bottom of the list.

You can complete a task, edit the tasks details (assuming you have permission to do so, see Working with Tasks for more info), and view comments about the task. Additionally you can view an appointment sheet, which is a printable summary of the contact – useful for a bit of last-minute cramming before a meeting.

## Opportunities

TODO

## People

The people tab allows you to record all the people you interact with at a Contact. Keeping track of people at a business allows you to target your interactions with the contact.

Selecting New Person will take you to a new person screen where you can enter their details. You only need to record the persons name, however optionally you can add information about their position, phone number, or email address.

## Products

The products tab allows you to record any relevant products installed or owned by the contact, as well as any contract details. This allows you to make more informed decisions during the sales process.

Selecting New Product will display a form for entering new product information, such as Product Type, Brand, Model etc.

You can also delete and edit individual product records.

## Comments

The comments tab displays any ad-hoc comments about the contact. This is for recording miscellaneous information about the contact ('Contact Y is a long standing customer, make sure to always enquire about the health of Joe Bloggs') that complements the sales process.

You can also attach files here, which will then be viewable by all other users.

Selecting New Comment will open a form for recording new comments via a textbox, and an optional file attachment field.

Administrators can also edit and delete existing comments in the list below.
