Tags are added to a contact as a way to identify a contact through an unlimited number of contexts. You can apply a filter to the contacts index to only show contacts with specific tags.

There are 4 types of tag, Global, Source, Type and Private. There are no hard and fast rules to what each type of tag has to be used for, but the below is a useful guide:

## Global Tags

Global (green) tags are used for generic categorisation of contacts, that don't fit into one of the below tag types.

For example, if you are using the Type tags to indicate the industry, and the global tags to indicate the size of the business. Or you could use the global tags to indicate which of your product categories or services the contact would most likely be interested in.

## Source Tags

Source (yellow) tags are generally used to indicate where the contact was sourced from, so it could be a tag that represents a marketing campaign, it could be used to indicate the staff member that generated the lead, or it could be used to indicate any other 'source' of contacts for the business.

## Type Tags

Type (red) are typically used to indicate the industry the contact operates in. This can be broken down further, with a tag per industry specialisation if most of your contacts operate in a similar industry.

Another way to use the type tag, instead of using an industry classification, is to indicate the size of the business. Or you might also use the type tag to indicate both industry and business size, in which case contacts would likely have 2 type tags.

## Private Tags

Private (blue) tags are a little different to the other types of tag, as they are only viewable (and filterable) by the person who added that tag.

<div class="note info">
  <span class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg">&nbsp;</span>
  <h5>A unique tag prefix is applied to the private tag, which is set in the users edit page in the admin section.</h5>
</div>

<div class="note info">
  <span class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg">&nbsp;</span>
  <h5>Administrators are an exception to viewing private tags, and can see all the tags applied to a contact.</h5>
</div>

## Bulk Attach/Detach Tags

On the Contacts Index, certain users have permissions to Bulk Attach or Bulk Detach Tags form a collection of Contacts. Using this function will attach or detatch the selected tags from all contacts in the current index (taking into account any filters that are currently applied).
