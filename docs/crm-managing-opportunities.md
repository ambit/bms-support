Opportunities are a way to manage your deal pipeline, by tracking the status of an 'Opportunity' with a Contact. Task, Activities and Comments can be attributed to an Opportunity.

## Opportunities Index

The opportunities index is an interactive representation of your deal pipeline, with various in built controls for managing the status of the opportunity, pausing it, or indicating the win/loss of the opportunity.

<div class="note info">
  <span class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg">&nbsp;</span>
  <h5>Clicking on the name of the opportunity will take you through to it's details page.</h5>
</div>

## New Opportunity

New Opportunities are created from within the Opportunity tab of a Contact. On clicking the New Opportunity button you will be presented with a form, to put in the details of the Opportunity.

<div class="note info">
  <span class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg">&nbsp;</span>
  <h5>The only required field is the Opportunity Name.</h5>
</div>

## Opportunity status

The status of the opportunity can be controlled from either the opportunities index, of by clicking on the menu button in the toolbar of the opportunity.

The main statuses are a progression of the different stages in the sales process - Lead, Pitching, Quoting, Closing, Won. Additional statuses are Paused, and Lost.


## Opportunity Activities and Tasks

Any Activities or Tasks you make from within an Opportunity will maintain their context. So they will be accessible from both the top level Activities and Tasks indexes, as well as from within the Opportunity itself.

<div class="note">
  <span class="fa fa-star fa-lg">&nbsp;</span>
  <h5>Use Activities and Tasks against Opportunities as a way to track what has been done, and what needs to be done, to progress the Opportunity to the next stage.</h5>
</div>
